      <p>
         Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter<br>
         who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.<br>
         In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings,<br>
         most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes,<br>
         portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive <br>
         and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not <br>
         commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness and poverty.

         <h2>Portraits</h2>
           The portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn.<br>
           He believed they were "the only thing in painting that moves<br>
           me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite." He wrote<br>
           to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure,<br>
           and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character<br>
           rather than aiming for photographic realism.

         <h2>Self-portraits</h2>
           Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889.<br>
           They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris<br>
           in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death. Generally<br>
           the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when<br>
           he was reluctant to mix with others, or when he lacked models, and<br>
           so painted himself.

         <h2>Flowers</h2>
           Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses,<br>
           lilacs, irises, and sunflowers. Some reflect his interests in the<br>
           language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e.There are two series<br>
           of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows<br>
           flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later<br>
           in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light.

         <h2>Cypresses and olives</h2>
           Fifteen canvases depict cypresses, a tree he became fascinated with<br>
           in Arles. He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen<br>
           as emblematic of death.The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured<br>
           the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields.

         <h2>Orchards</h2>
           The Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) are among the<br>
           first groups of work completed after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in<br>
           February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually<br>
           expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive<br>
           and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this<br>
           series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style<br>
           began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming<br>
           trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense<br>
           of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the<br>
           blossoming of the trees that spring, he found "a world of motifs that<br>
           could not have been more Japanese".

         <h2>Wheat fields</h2>
           Van Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape<br>
           around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural<br>
           landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); a good example of a<br>
           picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond. At various points,<br>
           Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris.
